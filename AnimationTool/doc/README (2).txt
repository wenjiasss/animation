Description:
The program is designed to help people who are artistically inclined, as well as people who may struggle with drawing or with creating animations. It is specifically designed so that people of all ages and artistic talent can use the program to its fullest and create masterpieces. We wrote the program because we want to make it easy for beginners to animate, as well as being useful enough for experienced animators and creators to be able to unleash their inner creativity. As artists ourselves, we think that many animation or drawing tools are either too expensive, or are affordable at the price of having lackluster tools and effects. Another problem that we recognize is how unfriendly and daunting some professional online art tools can be for beginners. That is why the program is aimed to be very user friendly as well as being helpful so that anyone can use the program easily and effectively. The main goal of the program is for the user to create an aesthetically pleasing animation without having too much difficulty or confusion with the program. Some rules that apply to the program is that the user cannot draw out of the allotted space of the frame, they cannot play the frames out of order without changing the order of frames first, they can’t copy or delete a frame that isn’t their current last frame, and most importantly of all, use their creativity! The aim of our project is for anyone with any amount of artistic ability to use our project, but people who are searching for the project may be people interested in creating art and animating, as well as anyone interested in learning more about creating art and animations. Primary features are the frames and the drawing tools. The timeline, which holds all of the frames, can be played through at a certain speed in order for the user to see their animation come to life. The drawing tools allow the user to draw and customize those frames to create whatever animation they dream up. 


Instructions:
         The user can draw by clicking and dragging across the screen with the mouse. The arrow keys allow the user to travel between frames. The left arrow key moves back a frame while the right arrow key moves forward a frame. Hitting the spacebar runs through the frames and plays the current animation. The user can also delete a frame by clicking on backspace. In addition, pressing m returns to the main menu. The number keys 1, 2, and 3  change the stroke thickness of the lines. There is also a set of letter keys for tools. For example, pressing on e would switch the tool to eraser, and r would switch the color to red. Pressing c will copy the current frame and bring the user to the copy. Pressing the up arrow will increase the speed at which the frames cycle, and pressing the down arrow will decrease the speed at which the frames cycle.
